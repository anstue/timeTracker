If you want to contribute, found a bug or want to refactor the code, please feel free to make a pull request.

Pull Request checklist:

* Make your code as nice as possible, maybe even have a look at: "The Clean Code" — Robert C. Martin

* No unnecessary comments

* Unit Tests

* ./gradlew checkstyle should show no errors

* execute the script buildAndDeployNewAppVersion.sh, it will do a checkstyle and test execution, the variables can be left empty
